# Projet 2 - Booki

github profile: https://github.com/Dread92


"Booki" is the second project in the junior web developer training program offered by OpenClassrooms.

Booki is a vacation booking website. In the scenario of project number 2, you are responsible for integrating a website mockup created by Loic, the UI designer.

Sarah, the CTO, sends you an email summarizing the various constraints and specifications to be followed.

The different constraints are as follows:

-The site must be coded in HTML/CSS without using any framework.

-Semantic tags (e.g., main, header, nav) must be used in the HTML.

-The site must be responsive and adapt to desktop, tablet, and mobile formats using media queries. The breakpoints are 992px for desktop to tablet and 768px for tablet to mobile.

-In the navigation menu, "accommodations" and "activities" should scroll to the corresponding element on the page when clicked by the user.

-The site should use the Raleway font (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway).

-Filters should change on hover, using a transform (scale) effect.

-The site's colors are #0065FC and #DEEBFF for the two shades of blue, and #F2F2F2 for gray.

-Flexbox should be used instead of Grid because the team is more familiar with it.

-All sizes should be expressed in pixels (px), not em or rem.

-The site must be compatible with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.).

Finally, the code must be W3C compliant for both HTML and CSS.
